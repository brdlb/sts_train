# Perudo Game Rules

## General Rules

The game can be played by 2 to 10 players, sometimes more, but the optimal number of participants is 3 to 5. Each participant receives 5 dice. The goal of the game is to keep your dice.

## Rolling the Dice

All players roll their dice, peeking at their own combination but not showing the result to other participants. The first move is made by the player who won the draw. They call out the number and value of dice that, in their opinion, are on the game table — among all players combined. All rolled **"ones"** are considered wild cards (jokers) and can be counted as dice of any value. The second player can either agree with the previous player's bet by making their own bet, or say **"I don't believe"** and **"let's check"**.

> **Example:** a player says "Five sixes". This means the player is betting that there are at least five sixes on the table.

## If the Player Agrees

If a player agrees with the previous player's bet, they must make their own bet. The following conditions must be met:

1. **The number of dice in the bet can only be increased.**
   - **Exception** — a player can reduce the number of dice in the bet by half (rounding up for odd numbers) if they call the value **"ones"**
   
   > **Example:** after a bet of "five fives" or after a bet of "six sixes", you can say "three ones".

2. **If the number of dice in the bet remains the same, the value must be increased.**
   
   > **Example:** you can say "three sixes" after a bet of "three fives", but you cannot say "five fives" after a bet of "five sixes".

3. **If the number of dice in the bet increases, then any dice value can be called.**

4. **If the value of the previous bet was "ones",** a player can only change the bet by increasing the number of dice in "ones" or by making a move with a different value, but with a number of dice one more than double the number of the bet in ones from the previous player.
   
   > **Example:** after a bet of "two ones", you must say "five twos" or "three ones".

## If the Player Doesn't Believe

All dice on the table are revealed and counted.

### Loss of the Player Who Made the Bet

If there are fewer dice of the value called by the challenging player on the table than the amount stated in the bet, the player who made that bet is considered the loser and places one of their dice in the center of the table.

> **Example:** one of the players made a bet of "5 threes". The player following them said "I don't believe". All players lifted their cups and recounted the dice with the value "three" and the value "one" (they are jokers), and it turned out that there are 4 "threes" on the table. In this case, the player who bluffed is considered the loser.

### Loss of the Player Who Didn't Believe

If there are more or equal dice of the called value than the number of dice in the bet, the player who said **"I don't believe"** is considered the loser. They must give one of their dice to the center of the table.

> **Example:** one of the players made a bet of "10 twos". The player following them said "I don't believe". All players lifted their cups and recounted the dice with the value "two" and the value "one" (they are jokers), and it turned out that there are 10+ "twos" on the table. In this case, the player who "didn't believe" is considered the loser.

After someone loses a die, the players roll the dice again and the losing player goes first.

## Special Round

If one of the players has only one die left, they can declare a **special round**:

- **"Ones" are not jokers.**
- **You cannot change the dice value** in subsequent bets.

> **Example:** after a bet of "one six" in a special round, the next player can only say "two (or more) sixes" — or not believe the previous player's bet.
