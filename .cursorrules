# Code Style Rules

## Language and Comments

- All code comments and docstrings must be written in English
- Error messages and user-facing strings should be in English
- Documentation and README files can be in any language, but code-related documentation should be in English

## Code Quality

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write clear, descriptive docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Project Structure

- Maintain modular architecture
- Keep imports organized and grouped
- Separate game logic, agents, training, and utilities into distinct modules

## Running Training

- The correct way to run training is: `python -m src.perudo.training.train`
- This command should be run from the project root directory
- Additional command-line arguments can be passed after the command (e.g., `--total-timesteps 10000`)
